### About me ###

I'm a beginner Java-developer. At the present time I'm at university at 4th course.
My faculty is called _Mathematical software and information systems administration_.

Iâ€™m currently learning several courses on Coursera (ML and OOP in Java).
Also I've finished following courses: _CCNAv7: Introduction to Networks_ and
_CCNAv7: Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials_ (by CISCO), _Kotlin As First_ (by Coursera).

I'm programming in _Java, C#, SQL, PL/SQL and MatLab_. Now I'm learning _Spring Framework_.

One of my biggest projects was _ARACE Method - a method for verbal decision analysis_.
I've developed java console project that can help you make decisions with big amount of criteria and alternatives.
In the future I'm planning finalize its functionality.
